# Contributing

This repository is the **C# / .NET reference binding** of the WMOOP World Model. WMOOP is a
multi-repository project, so the **canonical** contribution process, governance and ethics live in
the documentation repository, [`wmoop.doc`](https://github.com/WMOOP/wmoop.doc):

## Working in this repository

- **Build & run:** see the [README](README.md).
- **Checks:** the conformance vectors are shared by every binding and live in
  [`wmoop.doc/conformance`](https://github.com/WMOOP/wmoop.doc/tree/main/conformance). A new check
  is a vector there, not a test here. `Wmoop.Tests` only runs them.
- **Where changes belong:** the data classes are generated from the canonical WML model in
  [`wmoop.doc/model`](https://github.com/WMOOP/wmoop.doc/tree/main/model) by
  [`wmoop.tools`](https://github.com/WMOOP/wmoop.tools). `generated/` is written only by the
  generator, from the pinned submodules: never edit it; regenerate it as the README describes. To
  change data, change the **model** in `wmoop.doc`. Behaviour belongs here: in the hand-written half
  of a `partial` class under `Wmoop.Net/src/<Project>/`, or in `Wmoop.Patterns` (visitors,
  strategies, specifications).
- **Licensing:** by contributing you agree your contributions are released under this repository's
  [LICENSE](LICENSE) (Apache-2.0).
